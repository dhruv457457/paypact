# üí∏ PayPact: Decentralized Group Payments on Solana

![PayPact Banner](https://i.ibb.co/kgTCHyG9/Chat-GPT-Image-Aug-16-2025-01-47-47-PM.png)

**PayPact** is a decentralized application built on the **Solana blockchain** that simplifies, secures, and streamlines group payments. It empowers users to create shared payment "pacts," contribute via Solana Pay, and track all transactions on-chain for ultimate transparency and trust.

## The Problem

Managing shared expenses with friends, colleagues, or communities is often a messy process built on trust and manual tracking. Traditional payment apps are centralized, opaque, and can act as intermediaries, holding funds and controlling user data. In the Web3 space, coordinating group payments for things like NFT mints or DAO contributions still relies on sending funds to a single person's wallet, creating a single point of failure and a lack of transparency.

## The Solution: Trustless, On-Chain Pacts

PayPact solves this by moving the entire process onto the Solana blockchain.

  * **For Users:** It provides a simple, intuitive interface to create a payment pact, invite friends, and track contributions in real-time. No more chasing people for money or wondering who has paid.
  * **For Developers & Web3 Natives:** It offers a trustless, decentralized alternative. Payments are peer-to-peer, recorded immutably on-chain, and managed without a central authority. The "source of truth" is the public ledger, not a private database.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works: The Technical Flow

PayPact uses a hybrid architecture that leverages the best of Web2 and Web3 for a seamless experience.

#### Flow 1: Creating a Pact

This flow shows how a simple UI action for the user is powered by a robust backend and blockchain interaction.

1.  **Authentication (Web3Auth):** A user logs in with a social account. Web3Auth generates a non-custodial Solana wallet for them behind the scenes.
2.  **Frontend (React):** The user defines the pact details (name, amount, participants).
3.  **Metadata Storage (Firebase):** The pact's metadata is stored off-chain in Firebase Firestore for efficient retrieval and state management.
4.  **URL Generation (Backend):** A backend service generates a unique Solana Pay URL, embedding the `pactId` into the transaction's memo field.
5.  **QR Code:** The frontend renders the URL as a scannable QR code for participants.

#### Flow 2: Paying a Pact

This flow demonstrates the "magic" of on-chain actions triggering real-time updates in the UI.

1.  **Scan & Approve (Solana Pay):** A participant scans the QR code with their wallet and approves the transaction.
2.  **On-Chain Confirmation (Solana):** The payment is confirmed on the Solana ledger. The transaction memo contains the `pactId`, linking it back to our app.
3.  **Backend Listener:** A dedicated backend service monitors the organizer's wallet address for incoming transactions with a valid `pactId` memo.
4.  **Status Update (Firebase):** Upon detecting a valid payment, the listener updates the participant's status from `PENDING` to `PAID` in Firestore.
5.  **Real-Time UI Update (React):** The organizer's dashboard, which has a live listener to Firestore, updates instantly to reflect the payment.

## ‚ú® Spotlight: Web3Auth Integration

A core goal of PayPact is to make decentralized technology accessible to everyone, not just crypto natives. **Web3Auth is the key to achieving this.**

  * **Why Web3Auth?** We chose Web3Auth to eliminate the single greatest barrier to entry in Web3: complex wallet creation and seed phrase management. Traditional crypto onboarding is intimidating for new users.
  * **How it Works:**
    1.  A user clicks "Log in" and chooses their familiar Google, X, or other social account.
    2.  Web3Auth's SDK handles the cryptographic heavy lifting, generating a secure, non-custodial Solana wallet tied to their social identity.
    3.  The user is immediately onboarded with a real wallet and can start creating or paying pacts without ever needing to download a separate extension or worry about private keys.

This integration allows PayPact to feel as simple as a standard web app while providing the full security and self-custody benefits of a decentralized application.
